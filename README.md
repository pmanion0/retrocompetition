## Skipping Homebrew
I don't like Homebrew because of all the permissions changes, so I worked around the dynamic library thing with this code:

```
sudo make macosx install
```

Then add this code to the bottom of the `src/Makefile`:

```
liblua.5.1.dylib: $(CORE_O) $(LIB_O)
        $(CC) -dynamiclib -o $@ $^ $(LIBS) -arch x86_64 -compatibility_version 5.1.5 -current_version 5.1.5 -install_name @rpath/$@
```

Remaining commands:

```
make -C src liblua.5.1.dylib
sudo mv src/liblua.5.1.dylib /usr/local/lib/
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/opt/lua@5.1/lib/

sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/liblua.5.1.dylib /usr/local/opt/lua@5.1/lib/liblua.5.1.dylib
```
